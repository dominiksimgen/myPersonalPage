                <h3>Supply Chain Manager</h3>
                <p>Coming from a Business Administration background, I started my carrer as a trainee in the supply chain management organization
                     of a major international consumers goods company. 
                     I have been working in the field ever since, accumulating 10 years of experience as Supply Chain Manager. 
                     As part of the job, besides administration and planning, I already got my "feed wet" in the fields of ERP Systems, 
                     Data Science and Scripting/Automation. Therefore I am familiar with technologies like <strong>Python, SAP, Knime</strong> and <strong>Visual Basic.</strong>

                <h3>Computer Science Student</h3>
                <p>Inspired by my interest in the more technical aspects of Supply Chain Management, 
                    I decided to enroll in a Bachelor degree program in the field of Computer Science, 
                    where I attend University in the evening hours after my day job.
                    Since I enjoy the programming related classes the most, I intend to build a new career as Software Engineer. 
                    My basic knowledge includes languages & technologies like <strong>Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, MySQL & MongoDB.</strong>

                <h3>Photographer</h3>
                <p>I love to carry my camera with me while traveling the world. On every trip 
                    I spend half of my time with photography (and the other half enjoying local food, of course.) 
                    The majority of my library consists of photographs of far-away places.
                    Therefore, as part of a University assingment, I decided to combine my skills and build a (dummy) web-shop for photo-prints.
                    Check it out <a href="https://dominiksimgen.github.io/PhotoWebshop/index.html" style="color: var(--color4);">here</a>. Of course I have taken all of these pictures myself.
