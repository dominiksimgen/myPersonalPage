                <h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
                <p>Coming from a Business Administration background, I started my carrer as a trainee in the supply chain management organization
                     of a major international consumers goods company. 
                     I have been working in the field ever since, accumulating 10 years of experience as Supply Chain Manager. 
                     As part of the Job, besides administration and planning, I already got my "feed wet" in the fields of ERP Systems, 
                     Data Science and Scripting/Automation. Therefore I am familiar with technologies like <strong>SAP, Knime</strong> and <strong>Visual Basic.</strong>

                <h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
                <p>Inspired by my interest in the more technical aspects of Supply Chain Management, 
                    I decided to enroll in a Bachelor degree program in the field of Computer Science, 
                    where I attend University in the evening hours after my day job.
                    Since I enjoy the programming related classes the most, I intend to build a new career as Software Engineer. 
                    My basic knowledge includes languages & technologies like <strong>Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, MySQL & MongoDB.</strong>

                <h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
                <p>I started learning to code when I was 12 years old because I wanted to make my own video games. 
                    Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.</p>
